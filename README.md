## About
The project was developed for the [Software Development II](https://www.cse.uoi.gr/course/software-engineering-ii/?lang=en) course @ [cse.uoi.gr](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/)

The goal of this project was to re-engineer and extend an existing Java (LaTeX editor) app that was developed by other developers utilizing proper refactoring techniques and practices.

Throughout this project, choices regarding the refactoring of the existing code and implementing extensions were made keeping in mind coding principles, design patterns, and refactoring techniques we were taught in class such as the Open-Closed Principle (OPC), the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern (MVC), the Singleton Pattern, and various refactorings such as Duplicate Code, Dead Code, Large Class/Method, Extract Class/Method, Middle Man, Message Chains and Displaced Responsibilities.

## Objectives
Objective no. 1 was to find instances where bad design patterns were used and try to fix them using proper design patterns.

Objective no. 2 was to find instances where bad coding practices were used and again try to fix them using proper coding practices.

Objective no. 3 was to find bugs or misleading menus and buttons in the UX and rename them to something that makes more sense to the average user.

Objective no. 4 was to showcase that the user stories of the original application were still working after the refactoring process.

Finally, objective no. 5 was a critical objective that had to do with testing the refactored code and was tackled by creating proper jUnit tests.
